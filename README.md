### Overview of the Docker compose file
The provided, ready-to-use, Docker Compose file contains the following configuration (break down):

```
services:
  deegree:
    image: deegree/deegree3-docker:${DEEGREE_VERSION}
    container_name: deegree_${DEEGREE_VERSION}
    ports:
      - 8181:8080
    volumes:
      - ./deegree-workspace:/root/.deegree:rw
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_started
    networks:
      - network
```
The first service declared in the Docker Compose file is deegree, which runs the deegree web services. 
The specific version of deegree used is determined by the DEEGREE_VERSION variable defined in the .env file. 
The service depends on the successful startup of the PostgreSQL service (referred to as postgres). 
Once PostgreSQL is running, the deegree service is started. The deegree container also mounts a local 
directory (./deegree-workspace) to /root/.deegree within the container, ensuring that the workspace 
configuration is persistent and shared.

```
  postgres:
    image: postgis/postgis:${POSTGRES_POSTGIS_VERSION}
    container_name: postgres_database
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d inspire" ]
      interval: 5s
      retries: 3
    networks:
      - network
```
The second service is postgres, a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS extensions. 
The exact version is specified by the POSTGRES_POSTGIS_VERSION variable from the .env file. 
It exposes port 5432 and initializes the database using SQL scripts found in the ./sql directory, 
which are automatically executed at container startup.
```
  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:${PGADMIN_VERSION}
    container_name: pgadmin_${PGADMIN_VERSION}
    ports:
      - 5080:80
    environment:
      - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=pgadmin4@pgadmin.org
      - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=admin
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_started
    networks:
      - network
```            
The third service, pgadmin, is the pgAdmin 4 web interface, used for managing the PostgreSQL database via a web browser. 
This service also waits for PostgreSQL to start before initializing. 
The version of pgAdmin is determined by the PGADMIN_VERSION variable in the .env file, 
and it exposes port 5080 for access.
```
networks:
  network:
    name: deegree_workshop
```
At last, a custom Docker network named deegree_workshop is created. 
This network ensures that all services can communicate within the same isolated network environment, 
allowing containers to reference each other by their service names.

>**Info:** You can find an overview of basic Docker Compose commands at the end of this tutorial under: [Overview of basic Docker Compose commands](#overview-of-basic-docker-commands). 

### Specifying version variables for services

The `.env` file included in the provided `/deegree-workshop-bundle` defines specific version variables for 
the services used in the Docker Compose setup. This file contains the following environment variables (breakdown):

```
DEEGREE_VERSION=3.5.8
```
This variable specifies the exact version of deegree to be used. The Docker Compose file references this 
variable to pull the corresponding deegree Docker image.

```
POSTGRES_POSTGIS_VERSION=16-3.4
```
This variable defines the version of PostgreSQL along with its PostGIS extensions. The Docker Compose file references 
this variable to pull the corresponding PostgreSQL/PostGIS Docker image.
```
PGADMIN_VERSION=8.9
```
This variable sets the version of pgAdmin 4 to be used. The Docker Compose file references
this variable to pull the corresponding pgAdmin 4 Docker image.

Using these version parameters in the `.env` file allows for easy updates and consistent configuration across different setups.


## 1.4 Start the Docker compose environment

The Compose file, or `compose.yaml` file, follows the rules provided by the Compose Specification in how to define multi-container applications.

The default path for a Compose file is `compose.yaml` which is the prefered syntax. There are also other options such as the `compose.yml`, which is placed in the working directory.

With Compose there are also **still** supported options like the `docker-compose.yaml` and docker-compose.yml for backwards compatibility of earlier versions. If both files exist, Compose prefers the canonical `compose.yaml.`

#### Key commands

To start all the services defined in your `compose.yaml`file:


   docker compose up

This version however opens all the logs, which can be confusing.
>**Info** With a slight change in the command the logs can be observed easily. If any chances are made, look up the updated tutorials on https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-application-model/

The **prefered** command would be:

  docker compose up -d


To stop and remove the running services:

  docker compose down

If you want to monitor the output of your running containers and debug issues, you can view the logs with:

  docker compose logs

To lists all the services along with their current status:

  docker compose ps

#### Available endpoints
After you have succesfully started the Docker compose environment, the following endpoints are available:

**deegree Webservices**
*  http://localhost:8181/deegree-webservices

**pgAdmin Web Interface**
*  http://localhost:5080/


# 2. Import ProtecedSites data into the PostgreSQL database 

## 2.1 Use the deegree GmlLoader

In order to import GML data of the INSPIRE Annex 1 data theme ProtectedSites into the SqlFeatureStore of deegree, 
the `GmlLoader` of the deegree GML tools CLI is used. Since we are working with the Docker image of deegree, the CLI is 
already available under `/opt` in the deployed Docker container. Since the GML data is stored in the provided workspace and 
therefore also available on the Docker container, we can execute the `GmlLoader` with the one following commands.
Be sure to use the right container name, which can change depending on the configured `DEEGREE_VERSION` in the `.env`.

**One dataset**, 1317 polygon geometries, ~6 min duration (recommended):
```
docker exec -w /opt deegree_[YOUR_DEEGREE_VERSION] java -Xmx16g -jar deegree-tools-gml.jar GmlLoader -pathToFile=/root/.deegree/ps-sl/data/gmlData/ProtectedSites_Naturschutz.gml -workspaceName=ps-sl -sqlFeatureStoreId=INSPIRE_ProtectedSites_WFS
```
**Two datasets**, 7 polygon and 3340 point geometries, ~20 min duration:
```
docker exec -w /opt deegree_[YOUR_DEEGREE_VERSION] java -Xmx16g -jar deegree-tools-gml.jar GmlLoader -pathToList=/root/.deegree/ps-sl/data/gmlData/gmldatalist.txt -workspaceName=ps-sl -sqlFeatureStoreId=INSPIRE_ProtectedSites_WFS
```

>**Info**: Setting the Java parameter `-Xmx16g` (value dependent on the resources provided) is highly advisable, to avoid
> a Java `OutOfMemoryError`. Further information regarding the parameters of the GmlLoader can be found in the 
> [deegree documentation of the GML tools CLI](https://download.deegree.org/documentation/current/html/#deegree-gml-tools).

Beware that the `GmlLoader` can only be executed when the used SqlFeatureStore in deegree was created using the
`SqlFeatureStoreConfigCreator`, which is also a part of the deegree GML tools CLI. Since the configuration for this
tutorial is provided, the usage of the `SqlFeatureStoreConfigCreator` is not necessary. 
## 2.2 Use the pgAdmin 4 Web Interface 

After the import of the GML data using the deegree `GmlLoader` is finished, we can verify the content of the PostgreSQL
database using the pgAdmin 4 web interface. To do so, open [http://localhost:5080/](http://localhost:5080/) in 
your browser and use the following credentials to login into pgAdmin 4:

* **User**: pgadmin4@pgadmin.org
* **Password**: admin

Next, add your database server under:
##### Object > Register > Server...

After navigating to the said point through the toolbar, a pop-up window opens. Fill the tabs General and Connection with
the given information below.

**General**:
* **Name**: inspire_ps_server

**Connection**:
* **Host name**: postgres_database
* **Port**: 5432
* **User**:	postgres
* **Password**: postgres

>**Info**: The password is `postgres`, since the set Docker environment variable for the service postgres in the Docker Compose file is `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres`!

After connecting to the database server, you should see a database named `inspire` listed. If the GML data import was 
successful, the tables within the `schutgeb` schema will be populated with data. To visualize this data, expand 
the `inspire` database, then navigate to the `schutgeb` schema. Here, you'll find several tables that were created 
by the setup scripts executed during the Docker Compose environment initialization. To view the data, right-click 
on a table and select `View/Edit Data > All Rows`. This will run a predefined SQL query, displaying the data in 
the pgAdmin 4 web interface.

## 3. Use QGIS to visualize the data

### 3.1 Retrieve the WFS and WMS endpoints 

To retrieve the Web Feature Service (WFS) and Web Map Service (WMS) endpoints of the deegree workspace for the 
INSPIRE Annex 1 data theme ProtectedSites, navigate to the deegree web console with:
* http://localhost:8181/deegree-webservices

In the web console, go to the pre-configured web services under:

##### web services > services

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a WFS named `inspirewfs_Schutzgebiete` and a WMS 
named `inspirewms_Schutzgebiete`. By clicking the `Capabilities` button for each service, you can access 
the corresponding capabilities document in form of an XML response. This document provides metadata about the 
operations, services, and data offered by the service.

* WFS Capabilities: [http://localhost:8181/deegree-webservices/services/inspirewfs_Schutzgebiete?service=WFS&request=GetCapabilities](http://localhost:8181/deegree-webservices/services/inspirewfs_Schutzgebiete?service=WFS&request=GetCapabilities)
* WMS Capabilities: [http://localhost:8181/deegree-webservices/services/inspirewms_Schutzgebiete?service=WMS&request=GetCapabilities](http://localhost:8181/deegree-webservices/services/inspirewms_Schutzgebiete?service=WMS&request=GetCapabilities)

Based on the capabilities address, the endpoint for each service can be identified:

* WFS Endpoint: [http://localhost:8181/deegree-webservices/services/inspirewfs_Schutzgebiete](http://localhost:8181/deegree-webservices/services/inspirewfs_Schutzgebiete)
* WMS Endpoint: [http://localhost:8181/deegree-webservices/services/inspirewms_Schutzgebiete](http://localhost:8181/deegree-webservices/services/inspirewms_Schutzgebiete)

### 3.2 Launch QGIS

Launch QGIS on the device where your Docker Compose environment is set up.

If QGIS is not already installed, you can download the appropriate version for your operating system 
from [https://qgis.org/download/](https://qgis.org/download/) and follow the installation instructions.

> **Info**: You may also use other Geographic Information Systems (GIS) or similar software to visualize 
> your data, if preferred.

Once QGIS launched, create a new QGIS project with the Name `INSPIRE_PS`.

### 3.3 Add the WFS and WMS Endpoints to QGIS 

#### 3.3.1 Add the WFS Endpoint

Add a new WFS / OGC API - Features layer to your QGIS project under:

##### Layer > Add Layer > Add WFS / OGC API - Features Layer...

The following window should open:

![dms_wfs.png](resources/dms_wfs.png)

Click on the button `New` to add the WFS endpoint of deegree to your QGIS project, another window should open:

![config_wfs.png](resources/config_wfs.png)

In this window, set a name and the WFS Endpoint with the URL:
* [http://localhost:8181/deegree-webservices/services/inspirewfs_Schutzgebiete](http://localhost:8181/deegree-webservices/services/inspirewfs_Schutzgebiete) 

To complete the configuration, click the `OK` button. The current window will close, revealing the previous one. 
In that window, click the `Connect` button. A table displaying the available layers should then appear.

#### 3.3.1 Add the WMS Endpoint

Add a new WMS/WMTS layer to your QGIS project under:

##### Layer > Add Layer > Add WMS/WMTS Layer...

The following window should open:

![dms_wms.png](resources/dms_wms.png)

Click on the button `New` to add the WMS endpoint of deegree to your QGIS project, another window should open:

![config_wms.png](resources/config_wms.png)

In this window, set a name and the WMS Endpoint with the URL:
* [http://localhost:8181/deegree-webservices/services/inspirewfs_Schutzgebiete](http://localhost:8181/deegree-webservices/services/inspirewfs_Schutzgebiete)

To complete the configuration, click the `OK` button. The current window will close, revealing the previous one.
In that window, click the `Connect` button. A table displaying the available layers should then appear.

## 3.4 Load the layers in the QGIS workspace

After the two endpoints are added into QGIS, the data can be visualized.

Here is an example of all the layers provided by the WMS (one dataset):
![WMS.png](resources/WMS.png)

> **Info:** Depending on the used QGIS-Version, the WFS can or can not be visualized. This issue persists, as the INSPIRE
> GML structure is quite complex to process.
# 4. Validate the deegree Webservices

## 4.1 TEAM Engine 5.x:
* Docker Hub: [https://hub.docker.com/r/ogccite/teamengine-production/](https://hub.docker.com/r/ogccite/teamengine-production/)

To download the Docker image from the Docker registry run:

    docker pull ogccite/teamengine-production:latest

* Dockerfile available under: [https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine-docker/](https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine-docker/)


Run the TEAM Engine with the following command:
    
    docker run -d --name teamengine -p 8088:8080 --network="deegree_workshop_network" ogccite/teamengine-production

Next, open the TEAM Engine in your browser with: 

* [http://localhost:8088/teamengine](http://localhost:8088/teamengine)

Log in with the following credentials:

* **User**:	ogctest
* **Password**: ogctest 

> **Info**:	You can also create a new account, with the credentials stored locally, which are automatically deleted 
> when the Docker container is removed.

Use either the WFS or WMS to run the validation against:

* [http://localhost:8181/deegree-webservices/services/inspirewms_Schutzgebiete](http://localhost:8181/deegree-webservices/services/inspirewms_Schutzgebiete)
* [http://localhost:8181/deegree-webservices/services/inspirewfs_Schutzgebiete](http://localhost:8181/deegree-webservices/services/inspirewfs_Schutzgebiete)

For reference, the current deegree WFS 2.0 OGC Reference Implementation can be found online under:

* [https://cite.deegree.org/deegree-webservices-3.5.6/services/wfs200?service=WFS&request=GetCapabilities](https://cite.deegree.org/deegree-webservices-3.5.6/services/wfs200?service=WFS&request=GetCapabilities)

Further information about the TEAM Engine can be obtained under: 
* https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine

## 4.2 Further testing with the INSPIRE Reference Validator:

GitHub: [https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-validator](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-validator)

> **Info**: For this step, an existing GitHub account is required!

Run it using the following docker commands:

    docker login docker.pkg.github.com
    docker run --name inspire-validator --network="deegree_workshop_network" -d -p 8090:8090 -v ~/etf:/etf docker.pkg.github.com/inspire-mif/helpdesk-validator/inspire-validator:2024.2

The first command prompts you to log into GitHub using your GitHub-Account credentials. The second command launches a 
Docker container with the image of the INSPIRE Reference Validator, exposing the UI in port 8090 through the same port 
in the host machine. It uses a volume in the local file system, on the directory `~/etf`, which will create an `~/etf` 
folder inside the users home folder.

Once the Docker container is started, you can open the UI in your browser under: 
* [http://localhost:8090/validator/home/index.html](http://localhost:8090/validator/home/index.html)

# Troubleshooting Guide

### Docker Command Line Issues

- **Can't access Docker from the command line:**
    - Ensure the Docker daemon is running and use `sudo` if necessary.

### Docker Image Handling

- **Can't pull Docker image due to no Internet connection:**
    - Import a Docker image from a tar archive using:
      ```bash
      docker load -i <PATH_TO_USB_DRIVE>/Docker/postgis.tar
      ```

### Container Management

- **Error while starting Docker container:**
    - Verify system resources, especially available memory.
    - Monitor container stats with:
      ```bash
      docker stats <CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID>
      ```
      This will display CPU usage, memory utilization, and total memory available to the container.
    - Stop and remove the container, then restart:
      ```bash
      docker stop <CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID> && docker rm <CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID>
      ```

- **Checking Docker container logs for errors:**
    - Use the following command to view real-time logs:
      ```bash
      docker logs -f <CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID>
      ```

### Container Interaction

- **Attach to the Docker container to execute commands:**
    - Attach with:
      ```bash
      docker attach <CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID>
      ```
    - To detach while keeping the container running, use `CTRL-p CTRL-q` (ensure `-it` option is used with `docker run`).
    - Stop the container with `CTRL-c`.

- **Running commands inside the Docker container:**
    - Open a shell inside the running container:
      ```bash
      docker exec -it <CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID> '/bin/bash'
      ```
    - Exit the shell with the `exit` command.

### Network Troubleshooting

- **Can't access Docker container within the Docker network:**
    - List container IPs:
      ```bash
      docker network inspect bridge
      ```
    - Create and connect containers to a custom network:
      ```bash
      docker network create -d bridge --subnet 192.168.0.0/24 --gateway 192.168.0.1 inspire_network
      docker network connect inspire_network <CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID>

      ```
    - Retry accessing the Docker container.

### Database Interaction

- **Can't insert data into the database:**
    - Ensure the `inspire` user has all necessary privileges.
    - Grant privileges using:
      ```sql
      GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO inspire;
      GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO inspire;
      GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO inspire;
      ```
